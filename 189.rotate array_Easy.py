"""
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

    Approach #3 Using Cyclic Replacements [Accepted]

    """
    This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times,
    k elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the
    elements from the front shift backwards.

    In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then,
    reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest nâˆ’k elements
     gives us the required result.

    Let n=7 and k=3.
